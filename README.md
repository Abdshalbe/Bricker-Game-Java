## Project Description:
Bricker is a game in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle.
The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the computer's keyboard.
The player gets three lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen.

## Installation

First, a third-party library must be installed from here: https://danthe1st.itch.io/danogamelab  
It is also desirable to work with the IntelliJ code editor, but not mandatory.  
Now after creating the project, the third-party library must be added to the dependencies,  
we will do this by following the sequence of actions - File --> Project structure --> Modules --> Dependencies --> Add a new dependency --> Select the JAR folder.  
Now in the opened panel we access to the path where the third party directory is located and select there both the jar file and the *entire* src folder.  
Now click OK and the third party directory has been successfully added and you can use it.  

## Extensions
Features and extensions can be added to this game such as multiple players, more stages, unbreakable bricks, other strategies and game objects, etc.
